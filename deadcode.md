dead, useless code goes here!!!

the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
THEN I can enter an event
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage;
THEN the saved events persist;

                $('#RootNode').click(function(){
                    //do something
                });

                document.getElementById("RootNode").onclick = function(){
                    
                };
